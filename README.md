# Deprecated Ansible extension

This extension is now deprecated as a rewritten newer version was
published as [redhat.ansible](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.ansible)

As the newer version does not yet implement all the functionality, we will keep
the deprecated version alongside for some time.

Both extensions use the same github repository but keep in mind not to raise
bugs for the deprecated one as no fixes will be made for it. If you spot a
feature that was lost, open a bug for it, unless there is one already filed.
